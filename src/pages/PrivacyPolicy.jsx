            The internet is not a secure medium. However, we have put in place various security
            procedures as set out in this policy. Firewalls are used to block unauthorised traffic to
            the servers, and the actual servers are located in a secure location which can only be
            accessed by authorised personnel. We also keep your information confidential. Our
            internal procedures cover the storage, access, and disclosure of your information.

            the European Economic Area en route. By submitting your information, you consent to any
            such transfer. We may pass your personal information to other companies for processing on
            our behalf. Some of these companies may be based outside Europe in countries which may not
            have laws to protect your personal information, but in all cases we will ensure that it is
            kept securely and only used for the purposes for which you provided it. If you do not want
